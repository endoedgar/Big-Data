This MapReduce problem solves the counting of a list of people grouping them by
Country and Sex.

1) First we supply the input records to a file called FILE
	echo "1	Alfred	M	Germany" > FILE
	echo "2	Ana	F	Mexico" >> FILE
	echo "3	Antonio	M	Mexico" >> FILE
	echo "4	Around	M	UK" >> FILE
	echo "5	Berglunds	M	Sweden" >> FILE
	echo "6	Catarina	F	Russia" >> FILE
	echo "7	Joseph	M	Sweden" >> FILE
	echo "8	Robert	M	Sweden" >> FILE
	echo "9	Murphy	M	UK" >> FILE
2) Then we create the following folder structure inside HDFS
	- user
		+- cloudera
			+- challenge
				+- input
	using the following hadoop command:
		hadoop fs -mkdir /user/cloudera /user/cloudera/challenge /user/cloudera/challenge/input
3) After creating the folder structure, we put the file containing the input records inside the input folder in HDFS using the following command:
	hadoop fs -put FILE /user/cloudera/challenge/input
4) After this, we run the Jar using
	hadoop jar PairsMapperStripesReducerAlgorithmRelFreq.jar net.endoedgar.PairsMapperStripesReducerAlgorithmRelFreq /user/cloudera/hybrid/input /user/cloudera/hybrid/output
5) Then we execute the following command to show the output of the reducer:
	hadoop fs -cat /user/cloudera/challenge/output/*
6) It should display:
Germany	{M = 1}
Mexico	{F = 1}{M = 1}
Russia	{F = 1}
Sweden	{M = 3}
UK	{M = 2}
