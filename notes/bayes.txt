Probability of animal of height 

.2 * .1 = 0.02
.3 * .2 = 0.06
.5 * .3 = 0.15

Bayes Rule
P(A|B) = P(A)
	 ---- * P(B|A)
	 P(B)


P(A) = 
4 + 6
6 + 4
5 + 5
3/36

P(B) = 
1/6
P(A|B) = P(A).P(B|A) / P(B) 
P(A|B) A given B = A happened after B happened = 1/6
P(B|A) B given A = B happened after A happened = 1/3
